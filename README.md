#Sample Website with Persistent Data

This is a simple website with a form to capture visitor's name, store it locally using PersistJS so the name can be accessed after browser restart or even a computer restart. JQuery is use for simple form & data display interactions.

A data (name) reset is provided to remove stored value.
